Software Engineering Immersive Project 1 - Potato Pan Handler

Brief - Using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, create a game of my choice in a week.

I decided I would make up a game and try to create it. I settled on a cross between a rhythm game and a block-breaker game where you must use the correct input for each object as it reaches the bottom of the column.

Initially I planned out the rules of the game, and how I wanted it to look with a wireframe.

The first challenge in writing the fuctions for this game was figuring out how I could move blocks (as style classes) down the column while generating a new random one at the top when the player uses the correct input.
